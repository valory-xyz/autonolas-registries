# Internal audit of autonolas-registries
The review has been performed based on the contract code in the following repository:<br>
`https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-registries` <br>
commit: `tag: v1.2.2-pre-internal-audit` <br> 

## Objectives
The audit focused on fixing `PoAA Staking` contracts after C4A audit.

Please pay attention if possible.

#### Issue
```
Pay attention calculation for checkpoint().
serviceNonce - not needed to return
serviceIds - update before return
evictServiceIds - update before return
```

#### Notes
QA Report #108
SafeTransferLib.sol doesn't mask addresses for safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom
```
./contracts/staking/StakingToken.sol:        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(stakingToken, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
TL/DR: This is not a problem for our code. Ideally, change the version of the library to a newer one, but using the old one does not pose a danger to our code, where address is "cleaned".
Details:
The root of the potential problem is that we are using an old version of the library.
key point of the masking issue is if you put some garbage in the higher order bits of a 256-bit type and then cast it down (—Å)
Example non-issue cases:
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(stakingToken, msg.sender, to, amount); // own case
or
    uint96 a = type(uint96).max;
    address t = address(uint160(uint256(0x000000000000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)));
    Dummy memory dummy = Dummy(a, t); // "cleaning" by default
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(stakingToken, msg.sender, dummy.to, amount);

Example issue:
    uint96 a = type(uint96).max;
    address t = address(uint160(uint256(0x000000000000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)));
    bytes memory packed = abi.encodePacked(a, t); // special unclean higher order bits
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(stakingToken, msg.sender, address(uint160(uint256(bytes32(packed)))), amount); // special cast
or
    address to = address(uint160(uint256(0x0000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000))); // special cast
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(stakingToken, msg.sender, to, amount);

#### Etherscan/gnosisscan issue
```
contracts/staking/StakingProxy.sol
    /// @dev Gets the implementation address.
    function getImplementation() external view returns (address implementation) {
        assembly {
            implementation := sload(SERVICE_STAKING_PROXY)
        }
    }
It is necessary to carry out tests with the option to move this function to implementation.
Perhaps this will solve the problem with proxy recognition on the side gnosisscan.
